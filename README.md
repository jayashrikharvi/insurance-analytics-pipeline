# Insurance Analytics – Python + MySQL + Tableau

End-to-end pipeline that:
- Loads hospital & patient CSVs with Python
- Cleans and enriches the data
- Trains a regression model to predict insurance charges
- Stores data in MySQL (`insurance_db`)
- Creates an analytics view using SQL CTEs + window functions
- Visualizes metrics in Tableau (hospital performance, risk groups, rolling averages)
